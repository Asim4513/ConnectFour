Connect 4 to win the Game

# Minimax
A simulation of a two-player Connect Four game where one of the players is controlled by an AI using a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. The game is played on a 6x6 grid, and the players take turns dropping colored discs into a column until a player forms a straight line of four of their own discs either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The AI evaluates the board and determines the best move based on a set of scoring rules, aiming to block the opponent or secure a win. The board's state is displayed after each move, showing the progress of the game until a winner is declared or the board fills up. The AI's decision-making process involves considering future possibilities up to a certain depth and scoring the board states to choose the most advantageous move.
